### JSON file for RefillsItems
The following structure is currently used

```json
{
  "Company": "Balea",  
  "Name": "Tatoo",  
  "Tags": [
    "Refill;Hookable,True;"
  ],  
  "HookPosition": {
    "X": 0.0,
    "Y": 0.0,
    "Z": 8.0
  }
}
```

```HookPosition``` only needs to be set if this item can be attached to a hook.
